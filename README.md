# Firebase Studio E-Commerce Starter

This is a Next.js starter application for Firebase Studio, demonstrating a modern e-commerce experience with integrated AI features.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

## âœ¨ Enabling AI Features

This application includes advanced AI features powered by Google's Generative AI. To turn them on, you need to provide your Google AI API key. The setup depends on your environment.

### 1. For Local Development

For running the app on your local machine:

1.  **Get Your Key:** Generate a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  **Create `.env.local`:** Create a file named `.env.local` in the project's root directory.
3.  **Add the Key:** Add the following line to the file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the key you just copied:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
4.  **Restart:** Stop and restart your development server (`npm run dev`) for the change to take effect.

You can also find instructions for testing specific AI features by running the app and navigating to the `/docs` page.

### 2. For Production Deployment

When you deploy your site to Firebase App Hosting, the API key must be stored securely in Google Cloud Secret Manager. Your `apphosting.yaml` file is already configured to use this secret. This makes the key available to your application on the server, so your end-users will not need to provide their own keys.

**Prerequisites:**
Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following steps:
1.  **Install Google Cloud SDK:** Make sure you have the [Google Cloud SDK installed](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
2.  **Login to Google Cloud:** Authenticate with Google Cloud by running `gcloud auth login` in your terminal.
3.  **Set Your Project:** Configure the gcloud CLI to use your project ID with:
    ```bash
    gcloud config set project gen-lang-client-0049357498
    ```
4.  **Enable Secret Manager API:** Ensure the Secret Manager API is enabled for your project. You can enable it by running `gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com` or by visiting [this link in the Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/secretmanager.googleapis.com).

Follow these steps in your terminal:

1.  **Create the Secret:** This command creates a container for your key.
    ```bash
    gcloud secrets create GOOGLE_API_KEY --replication-policy="automatic"
    ```
2.  **Add Your Key as a Secret Version:** Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Google AI API key.
    ```bash
    echo -n "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" | gcloud secrets versions add GOOGLE_API_KEY --data-file=-
    ```
3.  **Deploy Your App:** Now you can deploy your application. Firebase App Hosting will automatically make the secret available to your app as an environment variable.
    ```bash
    firebase deploy
    ```
